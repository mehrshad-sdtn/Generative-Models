# Generative-Models
A repository for codes and projects related to Generative Models including: Autoencoders, VAEs, GANs, RBM

## Contents
#### 1. [Face Image-to-Sketch with Convolutional Autoencoders](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/Generative-Models/blob/master/autoencoder_sketching.ipynb)
Converting face images to sketches using convolutional autoencoder. Due to the small data size and limited variety, does not generalize well to generic faces. However the architecture could be easily applied to a more diverse and large dataset.

#### 2. [GAN and DCGAN on Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/Generative-Models/blob/master/GAN_fashion_MNIST.ipynb)
Using and Comparing GAN and Deep Convolutional GAN for generating MNIST fashion data samples
